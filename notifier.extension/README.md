**Notifer** add-in provides functionality for displaying global messages to all pages in a SharePoint site. Due to security restriction of the store, the add-in cannot registry global script (ScriptLink) in the SharePoint site.
**Notifier Extension** implemented as SharePoint Framework Application Customizer can register global script and load it in all "modern" pages.  
Hereby, the **Notifier Extension** extend the **Notifier** functionality and both together provide end user complete solution. 

This approach is supported from the Microsoft after [the recent Store policy adjustment](https://dev.office.com/blogs/combining-store-add-ins-with-high-trust-permissions).
